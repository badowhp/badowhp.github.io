Creating a webshop can be a challenging and complex process, especially when it comes to integrating various technologies and practices. In this blog post, we'll explore how to create a webshop with MedusaJS, an open-source e-commerce solution, and how to add DevOps practices to it.

## What is MedusaJS?

MedusaJS is a modern, open-source e-commerce solution that offers an alternative to traditional e-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce. It's built with Node.js and offers a highly customizable and extensible platform for creating e-commerce stores.

### Getting started with MedusaJS

To get started with MedusaJS, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you've installed Node.js, you can use npm (the Node.js package manager) to install MedusaJS. Here's how:


`npm install -g @medusajs/medusa-cli`

Once MedusaJS is installed, you can use the Medusa CLI to create a new MedusaJS project:

`medusa new my-webshop`

This will create a new MedusaJS project in a folder called "my-webshop". You can then navigate to this folder and run the development server:

1. `cd my-webshop`
2 .`medusa develop`

This will start the development server, and you can access your webshop by navigating to http://localhost:9000 in your web browser.

### Adding basic front end

We will use a simple example

`npm install gatsby-cli -g'

'gatsby new my-medusa-storefront https://github.com/medusajs/gatsby-starter-medusa'

`cd my-medusa-storefront`

`mv .env.template .env.development`

`npm run start`

Please keep in mind that we need to prepare also the database, which should in best case an service DB outside of our Kubernetes Cluster. Otherwise an dedicated DB Instance should be created in Cloud to be independent from Kubernetes Cluster.

The whole application will be containerized and the image will be built in our CI/CD pipeline already tagged with the newest version.

## Adding DevOps practices to your MedusaJS webshop

Now that you have a MedusaJS webshop up and running, it's important to consider adding DevOps practices to ensure that your webshop is scalable, reliable, and secure.

### Here are some DevOps practices that you can implement:

    Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD): Implementing a CI/CD pipeline can help automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your webshop. This can help ensure that your webshop is always up-to-date and running smoothly.

    Infrastructure as code (IaC): IaC is the practice of managing infrastructure using code instead of manual processes. This can help ensure that your infrastructure is consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled.

    Monitoring and logging: Implementing monitoring and logging can help you identify and troubleshoot issues with your webshop. This can include monitoring your server and application metrics, as well as logging errors and exceptions.

    Security: Implementing security practices, such as regular security updates, access controls, and vulnerability scanning, can help ensure that your webshop is secure and protected against attacks.

### Conclusion

Creating a webshop with MedusaJS can be a powerful and flexible solution for e-commerce stores. Adding DevOps practices can help ensure that your webshop is scalable, reliable, and secure. By implementing continuous integration and deployment, infrastructure as code, monitoring and logging, and security practices, you can create a webshop that can meet the needs of your customers and your business.
